## Summary
I am a full-stack software engineer passionate about building secure software and making software security more accessible for developers. Some technology stacks I enjoy working with include Python, TypeScript, FastAPI, ReactJS, and SvelteKit. My interest in software security led me to build [solomon](https://github.com/tuffgniuz/solomon) and [kodokai](https://kodokai.io), both tools aimed at improving the security of your project in a seamless and accessible way.
