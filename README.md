# Hi there ✌️

Hello! I'm a full-stack developer passionate about coding, with a background in Computer Science. My experience spans several languages such as C++, Java, Python, and TypeScript/JavaScript, and I'm familiar with frameworks including React, Angular, Svelte, Django, Flask, and FastAPI. I've also worked with Docker, Docker-compose, and Kubernetes, enhancing my skills in DevSecOps. My journey in tech includes a stint as a frontend developer and contributing to the Security Knowledge Framework. Currently, I'm developing projects like Security Champion and Kodokai, with a mission to simplify software security for developers. Outside coding, I connect with the wider community through YouTube tutorials and Medium articles, aiming to share knowledge.

#### Learning & Goals

Outside of software development, I'm dedicated to enhancing my skills in ethical hacking, focusing on mastering tools like Burp Suite. I actively apply this knowledge by rigorously testing and hacking my own applications, aiming to deepen my expertise in software security. This hands-on approach is part of my broader goal to excel in building more secure and resilient software systems.
